# Reinforcement(NEAT)- Python Pong
Using the Reinforcement NEAT algorithm to train an AI to play pong in Python!

# NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)
Python NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a popular algorithm for evolving artificial neural networks using a genetic algorithm approach. NEAT was introduced by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen in 2002. The primary goal of NEAT is to evolve neural network structures and weights that can perform specific tasks, such as solving complex problems or learning patterns from data.

To run the files first install the requirements.txt.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then after that there will be a training phase for the game.

To run the game training phase.

`python3 main.py`
